# Redis configuration file example

# Network settings
bind 0.0.0.0                    # Allow connections from all IPs (change for security)
port 6379                        # Redis default port
tcp-backlog 511                  # Maximum length of the queue for pending connections
timeout 0                        # No timeout for client connections
tcp-keepalive 300                # Keep-alive interval for TCP connections

# Security settings
protected-mode yes               # Enable protected mode (yes by default)
requirepass yourpassword         # Require clients to authenticate with this password

# Memory settings
maxmemory 256mb                  # Max memory usage for Redis
maxmemory-policy noeviction      # No eviction policy (you can set other policies like 'allkeys-lru')

# Persistence settings
save 900 1                       # Save data to disk every 900 seconds if at least 1 key has changed
save 300 10                      # Save data to disk every 300 seconds if at least 10 keys have changed
save 60 10000                    # Save data to disk every 60 seconds if at least 10,000 keys have changed
appendonly yes                   # Enable append-only file persistence
appendfsync everysec             # Sync the AOF file every second
no-appendfsync-on-rewrite yes    # Don't sync on AOF rewrite for better performance

# Logging and verbosity
loglevel notice                  # Set the logging level (could be 'debug', 'verbose', 'notice', 'warning')
logfile /var/log/redis/redis.log  # Log file path
syslog-enabled no                # Disable syslog logging

# Replication settings
# slaveof <masterip> <masterport> # Uncomment to configure replication (useful for master-slave setup)
# masterauth <masterpassword>    # Set if your master Redis server requires authentication

# CPU and disk optimization
hz 10                            # Redis event loop frequency (can adjust for performance)
slowlog-log-slower-than 10000    # Log queries taking longer than 10ms (in microseconds)
slowlog-max-len 128              # Maximum length of the slowlog (number of queries to log)

# AOF (Append Only File) settings
auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100  # Rewrite AOF file if it grows 100% bigger
auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb   # Trigger AOF rewrite if AOF file is larger than 64MB
dir /var/lib/redis               # Default directory for Redis database files

# Database settings
databases 16                     # Number of databases (default is 16)

# Cluster settings (if applicable)
cluster-enabled no               # Disable Redis Cluster mode (change to 'yes' if using clustering)
